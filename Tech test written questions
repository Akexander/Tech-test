Why do we test our software as engineers:
	To confirm that your product is a working (sellable) item 		
  for the end uses or clients. That will not fail in the field 			
  or create avoidable expense and loss of time, 				
  reputation and profit once deployed.

What best practices are there for testing software:
	Possibly the best type of testing is a testing mindset. 			
  Writing tests before you have written your code Test-			
  Driven Development (TDD), will help build clear concise 	
  code. Unit testing, integration testing and end to end 			
  testing will be much easier when code has been written 		
  with this in mind and test procedures planned in 				
  advanced.


Where you have applied those best practices:
	I have applied these best practices on several projects 		
  including the building of my calculator, the creation of 			
  my Morse to English translator and my Punk API project
